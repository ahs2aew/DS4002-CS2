Here is the link to the dataframe you will use for the project: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snapcrack/all-the-news 

This dataframe contains information about roughly 150,000 news articles from 15 major U.S. publications. 
There are columns for the article title, article content, and so on. 
Since this dataframe includes text data (the article title and content), sentiment analysis could be a useful tool in completing the project. 
There will be further materials concerning what sentiment analysis is/how it could be applied in this context - check the other materials in this folder!
