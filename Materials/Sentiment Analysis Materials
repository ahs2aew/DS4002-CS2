# What is sentiment analysis? 
Sentiment analysis is a tool that can be used to determine what the tone, or sentiment, of text is : is it positive, negative or neutral? Is it angry, 
excited, or happy? In this way, sentiment analysis can be used to determine how polarizing a piece of text is. 
There are a variety of packages in Python that can be used to perform sentiment analysis. Textblob and VADER are some commonly used ones. With 
textblob, there is a built in process to determine the polarity of a sentiment -- it can determine how strongly positive or negative a statement or 
entire article is. For the text you feed in, TextBlob can output a polarity score that ranges from [-1,1]. If the score is -1, that means that the 
piece of text is extremely negative, and if the score is +1, the text is extremely positive. 
Before you get into that part, though, you will need to tokenize the text - this basically means that you make the text easier to work with. It involves 
making all words lowercase, and taking out punctuation. 
Below will be some links to helpful resources. This folder will also contain sample code for these processes -- check the "Sample Code" folder.

# How could sentiment analysis help with this project? 
The "polarity score" aspect of Textblob could be useful for this project. Again, the goal is to determine what the most "attention-seeking" publication is.
One potential avenue to explore this could be looking at how polarizing the text of article titles/article content is for each publication. 
A publication that is more attention seeking might be one that uses highly polarized language in their titles or article content (or both). 
You have full latitude to come up with whatever definition of "attention seeking" makes the most sense to you, but this is one suggestion!
